# First time with TypeScript and Next Js

I follow a youtuber to learn NextJS with TypeScript.

- So far I have learned about routes, metadata, props, events, context with reducers and about the 404 page.

---------------------------------

- This time I learnt about sources, server-side components and client-side components, data fetching, loading components.
