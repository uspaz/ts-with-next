# First time with TypeScript and Next Js

I follow a youtuber to learn NextJS with TypeScript.

- So far I have learned about routes, metadata, props, events, context with reducers and about the 404 page.

---------------------------------

- This time I learnt about sources, server-side components and client-side components, data fetching, loading components.

---------------------------------

- I practiced on my own to improve my skills in the topic of dynamic routes, and it was challenging due to numerous errors with typescript, but I still understood the topic. Although I should keep practicing.

---------------------------------

- I saw something about useRouter and also worked a bit with the api folder, installed postman to practice the methods and saw a bit more how to handle parameters with params and searchparams.
